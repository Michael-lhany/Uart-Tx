# UART_Tx project
## Description
* There are many serial communication protocol as I2C, UART and SPI.
* A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a block of circuitry responsible for implementing serial communication.
* UART is Full Duplex protocol (data transmission in both directions
simultaneously)
* Transmitting UART converts parallel data from the master device (eg. CPU) into serial form and transmit in serial to receiving UART.
* Receiving UART will then convert the serial data back into parallel data for the receiving device.
*On this project we will focusing on the transmitting UART
